    <h2>Ingrediants:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds baking potatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans</li>
        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>chopped fresh chives (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prick potatoes with a fork. Transfer to a 10x15-inch baking pan.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until tender, about 1 hour.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, for chili, add ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring to break up lumps, until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain grease.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Add tomato sauce, chili beans, and chili seasoning mix to saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, at least 10 minutes to let flavors meld.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>When potatoes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop potato pulp into large bowl. (You should have about 4 cups pulp). Discard skins. Add broth to bowl. Mash potatoes until smooth.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook, whisking constantly to make a light roux, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, 1 cup at a time. Cook, whisking constantly, until lightly thickened. Stir in potato mixture, buttermilk, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes (soup will be very thick). Remove from heat and gradually stir in 1 cup cheese.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Divide soup among bowls. Top with chili, sour cream, remaining 1/2 cup cheese, and chives (if using).</p>
